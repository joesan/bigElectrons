A blog on a pair of shoes? A bit unusual for my blog that I'm writing about a pair of shoes. It is still just a shoe, but it is a Red Wing Chukka, the 3140 in the Oro-Iginal leather. There is a reason why I'm writing about this piece of hardware that brings joy and comfort to my knee and foot. I have experienced pain in my left knee for days together after walking with my current shoe and trust me, this is no fun.</description></item></channel></rss>
