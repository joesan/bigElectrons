Definition Simply put, a Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure with which we can determine the probable existence of a certain thing in a certain data set, and we can determine the non-existence of a certain thing in a certain data set with utmost accuracy. Doing all this in a memory space efficient manner.
In a gist, Bloom filters are about determining if an element {{ textcolor(color=&amp;quot;red&amp;quot; text=&amp;quot;may be in a set&amp;quot;) }} or {{ textcolor(color=&amp;quot;red&amp;quot; text=&amp;quot;is definitely not in a set&amp;quot;) }}</description></item><item><title>CCTV Monitor with Raspberry Pi &amp; OpenCV</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/mlandai/raspi-with-opencv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/mlandai/raspi-with-opencv/</guid><description>
I wanted to play around with OpenCV and thought it might be a good idea to try OpenCV with a real life use case. DIY'ing a home camera system that can do motion detection and click images when there is some movement in the frame sounded like a cool idea. So I researched on how I could get this set up done.
There were quite a few things that I should decide, like for example.</description></item></channel></rss>
