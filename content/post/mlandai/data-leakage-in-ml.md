Data leakage is a critical issue in machine learning that can lead to overly optimistic performance metrics and poor 
generalization to new data. This article explains what data leakage is, why it is problematic, and how to avoid it 
during data pre-processing.

## What is Data Leakage?

Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model. This means that the 
model inadvertently has access to information that it wouldn't normally have in a real-world scenario. As a result, the 
model's evaluation metrics are misleading because it performs better on the test data than it would on unseen data.

***Data Leakage typically happens by applying data preparation techniques to the entire dataset.***

To keep it simple, when we do data pre-processing we calculate some summary statistics like mean, variance etc., from the
data set. Now if we calculate these summary statistics for the entire dataset and use that summary statistics to train
the model, and then split the train and test data, the model already knows about the summary statistics of the test data
and will perform better. But this is seriously a bad idea as in real world, for some other real world data, your model will
suffer terribly!

## Why is Data Leakage a Problem?

### Misleading Performance Metrics

When a model is trained with leaked information from the test set, it appears to perform exceptionally well during 
evaluation. This leads to performance metrics that do not accurately reflect the model's true predictive power. Consequently, 
the model may not perform as well in real-world applications as the evaluation metrics suggest.

### Poor Generalization
The primary goal of a machine learning model is to generalize well to new, unseen data. If the model has learned from the 
test data, it is likely to over-fit to the specifics of that data and fail to generalize. This results in poor performance 
when the model encounters new data that it hasn't seen before.

## Example of Data Leakage

Consider a scenario where you are working with a dataset and want to split it into training and test sets. You then standardize 
your features using a StandardScaler. The scaler computes the mean and standard deviation of the features to transform 
them. Here's an example of how data leakage can occur:

### Incorrect Approach: Fitting on Combined Data

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Example data
data = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]])
target = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0])

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Incorrectly fitting on combined data
combined_data = np.concatenate([X_train, X_test], axis=0)
scaler.fit(combined_data)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

In this example, the scaler uses information from the test set to calculate the mean and standard deviation. When the 
test set is transformed, it's no longer an independent set, leading to misleadingly high performance metrics.

### Correct Approach: Separate Fitting and Transformation

```python
# Initialize the scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit and transform the training data
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Only transform the test data
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

By fitting the scaler only on the training data, we ensure that the test data remains unseen during training, providing 
a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.

## Practical Implications of Data Leakage

### Model Evaluation

When you avoid data leakage, the performance metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) reflect the model's true 
ability to generalize to new data. This gives a realistic measure of the model's effectiveness.

### Avoiding Over-fitting

Preventing data leakage helps the model avoid over-fitting to the specifics of the test data. This ensures that the model 
learns patterns that generalize well to new, unseen data.

## Real-World Application

Models that are evaluated without data leakage are more likely to perform well in real-world scenarios. They are robust 
and reliable because they have been tested on truly unseen data.

## Summary

Data leakage can significantly impact the performance and generalization of a machine learning model. By carefully separating 
the training and test data during data pre-processing, and ensuring that transformations are fitted only on the training 
data, we can avoid data leakage. This practice leads to more accurate performance metrics and better generalization 
to new data.

By adhering to these principles, you can build robust machine learning models that perform well in real-world applications 
and provide reliable performance estimates.
