There are things that you might have learnt during your time in high school, but nevertheless I wanted to keep a summary of the main terminologies
as a reference. Rather than just blind folded detailing on the terms, I will try to associate it with a story. A story where using these concepts helped me
understand where I stand when it comes to performing my best at XC and Enduro Mountain Biking.

Here's the Prologue:

## Mean

The average should give you an idea of what is the commonality in a given set of sample data. In other words, mean represents the value where we could generalize
on a given sample data set.

## Median

## Mode

## Range

## Quartiles

## Percentiles

## Variance
Variance is a measure of the spread of a given dataset from the mean. For example., if you are given a set of house prices, calculating
the variance on the house prices could tell us how spread or how far is that data is from the mean.

## Standard Deviation
Variance is not intuitive enough. I mean when you think about it, it is just the sum of squared distance from the mean divided by the 
total number of points. All we are interested is the distance and not the squared distance. Hence, we can take the square root
from the squared distance. Once we do this, it becomes intuitive enough to say that "How far or how spread is my data to the mean" and this
is called the Standard Deviation.

It is these basic ideas that build up to much more advanced concepts. My intention is not to detail and write about Statistics in-depth, but rather to document
the very important terms and their fundamental meaning that would help for further exploration in the subject. I'm not even talking about Probability in this
article, but to be able to fully appreciate Probability theory, it is vital that you nail down these basics laid out here.02

If you are after a comprehensive list of all the terminologies in Statistics, []here is a good alphabetically summary](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm)
that might be useful.
