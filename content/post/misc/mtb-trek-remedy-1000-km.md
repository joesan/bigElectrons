So as of today, I managed to clock on record a total of 1000 Km with my Trek Remedy 8. It is obviously much higher than that as for several rides I haven't 
turned my Sigma odometer device. But for the record, the mileage is 1000 Km for this year so far.

I have explored much of the singles trails around my area! It was fun riding this bike! I hope to do even more miles for the next season!
