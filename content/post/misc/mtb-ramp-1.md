What does "Send it mean? It's a jargon used within the Mountain Biking community, especially the Downhill community that indicates that you are about to hit a jump and that you have to clear the jump! 
Jumpin on the trails requires technique, a lot of practice. One way to practice the technique is to do it using some artificially made ramps! That exactly 
was my DIY project this weekend! I went to the local store "Bauhaus" as it is called here in Germany and shopped for some wood and nails.

The dimensions for the ramp I wanted are {h = at least 30cm, l = at least 60cm}

<p>I made the choice that my ramp should be at least 30cm from ground so that I have some decent enough lift off! For this to happen, I had to buy a single 
piece of wood and have it cut into pieces! I would then assemble the pieces together using the nails!

Here are some pictures!

It was fun to build it and it roughly took me 40 minutes to get it done! It is not perfect, but for what it cost me (roughly 15 Euros), this is absolutely 
fine! I will probably test it the next days, I'm sure I'll have fun with it!
