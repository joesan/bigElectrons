Today, I drove to DÃ¼sseldorf to Mountain bike the Aaper wald. I made a nasty mistake of not having enough breakfast. It started good, but after reaching the foot of the hill, 
I started to ride the up-hill section. After pedalling for about a minute or two, I started to notice that my legs were pounding hard. I feel that this must 
be the activity of my heart trying to pump more blood to my legs to feed them with power. After a while, the slope got even steep, I could not pedal 
it anymore, so I got down and started to tow my bike. It was demanding! 

Once I reached the peak, I started to get tired and felt a pounding sensation on my face, I started to feel dizzy. It was within seconds, I blacked out!

The following event is as told by my friend who was with me for the ride!

I fell down un-conscious, my bike fell over me. My fried then took the bike away and called me twice after which I got my consciousness back and got up! It 
was roughly less than 10 seconds where I went un-conscious! My friend told me that while I was un-conscious, my eyes were still open, he was not sure if 
I was breathing or not! I'm glad that I came back. I'm thankful to my friend that he called my name which I feel was the trigger to get me back to 
consciousness! After waking up, I felt as though I was sleeping for longer and while I was un-conscious, I was dreaming of something! Not sure what I was 
dreaming about. For about 20 to 30 seconds of waking up, I was still a bit dizzy, I was slowly getting back to normal. I had some water to drink and was 
just asking my friend about what happened to me.

It was after this incident, we drove through the forest for about 16km, both uphill and downhill where I was shredding the descents! I'm glad and thankful
to my friend who offered me a sumptuous lunch with Salmon and some excellent coffee. It was a memorable day!
