## What happened?

It was time to move again! In one of my [earlier posts](blogger-to-gh-pages.md), I have mentioned my move from
Blogger tp GH-Pages and for that I decided to go with Zola. It was all fine, but after a few months, I wanted to have
few additional features for the [theme that I was using](https://deepthought-theme.netlify.app/). It was such a great and
a simple theme and looked so elegant, but some features that I was in dire need of was kind of missing. 

So I decided that it was time to move on and started to explore on Hugo. I came across this yet another 
[beautiful theme](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity) that I could not resist as it was ticking the boxes for all
what I want (as of today). Without hesitation, I started to migrate my blog content, and the CI / CD build to reflect this
new theme that is based on Hugo. After some hurdles, I was able to move everything from left (Zola) to right (Hugo) in
just a day.

Kudos to these SSG's (Static Site Generators), they are really awesome.
