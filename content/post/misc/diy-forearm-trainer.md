I occasionally get physically active and do some training. I was figuring out what kind of physical activity that
I could do when I'm sitting. This is when I thought about doing some exercises for the forearm. 

As I'm someone who loves to DIY, I wanted to figure out which actions I want my forearm to do, and I remember being a 
teenager doing some dumbbell training that had to be rolled with both your arms stretched out. I wanted something
kind of similar to that, but not having to stand up which is when I came up with this thought of putting some
simple parts together and construct a stick grenade like device that can be used.

Here is what I came up with:

All the parts used are sourced from a local hardware store, but nevertheless here is a quick summary of what I used:

1. Galvanized steel nipple - 180mm in length and has a diameter of around 3.5cm
2. Steel caps for both the ends as per the dimensions
3. Range extender that goes from 3.5cm to 5cm in diamater
4. Small steel nipple that can be attached to the range extender - 10cm in length and 5cm in diameter

With a few rubber dampeners, I have the whole set up ready. Now all what I need is a Olympic sized weight plate that I 
need to insert on the top end of this stick. I hope to pue this one to good use when I'm sitting resting!
