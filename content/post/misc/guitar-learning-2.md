Recently, I can say that I made very good progress playing across the neck of my guitar. I memorized few pentatonic shapes, but I was stuck the whole while on
those specific boxes. The whole thing did not make any sense to me. Just wandering within those boxes is not pleasant music. Frustrated, I looked at
Youtube for some motivational ideas on how to unstuck me from the boxes.

Luckily, this one video in Youtube that I found on a random search helped me immensely.

The idea is to think in terms of triangles and move back and forth to those triangles. Man this was wonderful, and I now get the idea!
