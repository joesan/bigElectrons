## Climbing the Pentatonic scales
Recently, I can say that I made very good progress playing across the neck of my guitar. I memorized few pentatonic shapes, 
but I was stuck the whole while on those specific boxes. The whole thing did not make any sense to me. Just wandering within 
those boxes is not pleasant music. Frustrated, I looked at Youtube for some motivational ideas on how to unstuck me from the boxes.

Luckily, this one video in Youtube that I found on a random search helped me immensely.

The idea is to think in terms of triangles and move back and forth to those triangles. Man this was wonderful, and 
I now kind of get the idea! This helped me a lot in playing across the neck of my guitar. I now need to practice this
for speed and even more accuracy. If you feel like you are stuck in a box, that video there is a real eyeopener. Go watch it!
