I just came back from my vacation in Paris. Just thought of writing down my experience and what I did with my family
while in Paris. 

## How to Reach Paris

We decided that we will drive to Paris. From where we are located, it just takes us a 6 to 7-Hour drive by car. On the
way, there are plenty of rest places with sufficient facilities for food. 

## Where to Stay

There are tons and tons of options. I just found a hotel randomly at booking.com near Malakoff, and it is about 10 to 15
Minutes away (with the Metro) from the attractions in Paris (Eifel Tower, Louvre Museum). If you are planning a trip to Paris,
better find a hotel that offers you a private car park. It is better to avoid using your car to explore Paris due to 
safety concerns, and the other main reason being that the Metro in Paris is one of the best and efficient ways to move around.

## What to do 

TODO: Write about....

### The Eifel Tower

We just had 2 full days and one half a day to explore Paris. We thought of doing two attractions every day, but man we were
wrong. It was so crowded everywhere due to the holiday season, and we had to wait hours together to get into the attractions. 

Our first stop was the Eifel Tower, one of the world wonders. I was unable to secure any online tickets before my visit, so 
we had to wait at the queue to secure an entry, and we had to wait for about roughly 2 Hours to get to the ticket counter. 
I thought everything after that would be quick, but I was wrong again. We had to wait for another 30 to 45 minutes to get 
into one of the elevators that would take us to the second floor. Once in the second floor, we spent some time gazing at
the city of Paris. Again here getting access to the view point was a challenge because of the huge crowd. However, after a
few minutes of struggle and changing positions, we were able to secure a spot to view the cits of Paris. 

After clicking some snaps, we moved to the lift to take us to the summit. Again some waiting time! Once at the summit, it
was more or less the same situation as on the second floor. If you are fear of heights, the summit is not for you. We clicked
some snaps and tried to locate the other attractions in Paris. We were able to spot a few of them. Overall, we enjoyed visiting
the Eifel tower minus the huge crowds. We came down to the second floor, and we decided to take the stairs. It was fun doing so!

We were so tired after the drive, the wait and the visit to the Eifel tower. We went back to our rooms to retire for the day. It was so
warm, sultry and hot the entire day.

### Galeries Lafayette

The original plan for this day (was a Sunday) was to visit the Louvre museum, but somehow I decided to visit the Lafayette. I had
to fight a migrane that had set in because of yesterday. We started from the hotel around 9:30 and reached Lafayette in about 30
minutes. We fell in love with the Metro in Paris. It was easy to get by yourself with little to no help. After reaching Lafayette, we
realised that it opens only at 11:00 on Sundays. But never mind, we went into the McDonalds nearby and had our breakfast.
