open-electrons is an attempt by myself to abstract all e-mobility related protocols, use cases and much more. In the E-Mobility
industry, there are some well known protocols which are industry standard. With the open-electrons project, my aim is to
provide a software stack which can be customized and deployed to mimic the functionality of an eMSP (eMobility Service Provider).

For more information, have a look [here](https://open-electrons.github.io/home/) for some basic documentation 
and [here](https://github.com/open-electrons) for the source code. Please note that not all the project source
is in public mode. Fell free to get in touch with me for access to the projects.
