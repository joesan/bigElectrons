## Keep it Relevant

In today's world of maintaining a project dependencies, it is inevitable to leave this job to a bot and tie the
whole process into an automatic CI / CD pipeline where the bot is responsible for keeping your dependencies up to date.

I would like to share once such approach that I undertook to keep one of my open source projects up to date. It
actually stems from the pain that I had when I had to update some dependencies, and they were kind of
breaking my build. So I wanted to guage what options are available and settled with Mergify which is free as of now
for open source projects.
